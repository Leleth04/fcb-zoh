Joining a coding bootcamp is an investment in your future as a web developer. It provides a structured, hands-on learning environment where you can rapidly build the skills needed to start a career in tech. With expert guidance, practical projects, and a focus on industry-relevant technologies, you'll gain the confidence and experience to stand out to employers. Plus, you'll join a supportive community of like-minded individuals, all working toward the same goal—launching your career in web development.

I have seven years of experience in a government office, where I worked as a Data Controller and Customer Support Assistant, managing data, maintaining records, and providing support to both internal teams and the public. For the past year, I've been working as an Accounts Payable Specialist, handling invoice processing and vendor relations. Now, I’m eager to return to my roots as a Computer Engineering graduate and pursue my interest in web development. I’m excited to build on my technical background and explore new skills in coding and web technologies.
